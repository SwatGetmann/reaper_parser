# Reaper Parser

Parser for Reaper project files (*.rpp).

## Why am I doing this?

One of my goals is to make a library of my Repaer projects, so I can sort them and edit metadata without actually opening the Reaper.

So, the parsing of RPP projects is necessary for that matter.

## Running

```bash
python --file_path <path to rpp file>
```
